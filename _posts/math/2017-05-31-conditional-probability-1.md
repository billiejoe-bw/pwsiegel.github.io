title: Conditional Probability I Bayes' Rule
abstract: The goal of mathematical modelling is to make predictions based on limited data. The Bayesian approach to this problem is to organize the data we have into a probabilistic model which is "most likely" to explain it. This post introduces Bayes rule and the language of conditional probability in which it is expressed; subsequent posts will explore the surprising subtleties of this language in more detail.

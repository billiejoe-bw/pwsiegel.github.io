<span class="definition">
A function $f(x)$ is said to be _continuous_ at a point $a$ if:

$$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$$
</span>

<span class="definition">
A function $f(x)$ is said to be _differentiable_ at a point $a$ if:

$$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$$

exists.
</span>

<span class="lemma">
If $f(x)$ is differentiable at $a$ then $f$ is continuous at $a$.
</span>
<span class="proof">
We have:

$$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) - f(a) = \lim_{x \to a} (x - a) \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} = 0$$

(The latter limit exists since $f$ is differentiable at $a$.)

The best things in life are free, and hence cost <span>$</span>0.

Macro test: let $(\R^n, \inner{\cdot, \cdot})$ be a Euclidean space.

# Testing some math

Let's see if we can get the environments to work.

<div class="definition">
A function $f(x)$ is said to be <i>differentiable</i> at a point $a$ if:

$$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$$

exists.
</div>

<div class="lemma">
If $f(x)$ is differentiable at $a$ then $f$ is continuous at $a$.
</div>
<div class="proof">
Let

$$L = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$$

Given $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that:

$$\left| \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} - L \right| < \varepsilon$$

We are free to assume that $\varepsilon < 1$, so rearranging we get:

$$\left| f(x) - f(a) \right| < (\left| L \right| + 1) \left| x - a \right|$$

Choose $\delta'$ smaller than both $\delta$ and $\frac{\epsilon}{\left| L \right| + 1}$ and the result follows.
</div>

Is inline math still going to work outside of environments? Here's a test: $\frac{1}{x^2}$.

Also, how will I type the dollar sign?  Maybe /$?

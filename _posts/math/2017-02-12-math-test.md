# Testing some math

Let's see if we can get the environments to work.

<div class = definition>
A function $$f(x)$$ is said to be _differentiable_ at a point $$a$$ if:

$$\lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$$

exists.
</div>

<div class = lemma>
If $$f(x)$$ is differentiable at $$a$$ then $$f$$ is continuous at $$a$$.
</div>
<div class = proof>
Let

$$L = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$$

Given $$\varepsilon > 0$$ there exists $$\delta > 0$$ such that:

$$\left| \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a} - L \right| < \varepsilon$$

whenever $$|x - a| < \delta$$.  We are free to assume that $$\varepsilon < 1$$, so rearranging we get:

$$\left| f(x) - f(a) \right| < (\left| L \right| + 1) \left| x - a \right|$$

Choose $$\delta'$$ smaller than both $$\delta$$ and $$\frac{\epsilon}{\left| L \right| + 1}$$ and the result follows.

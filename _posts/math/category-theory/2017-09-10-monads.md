## Examples of (co)monads

Recall that an adjunction between categories $\C$ and $\D$ consists of a pair of functors $F \colon \D \to \C$ and $G \colon \C \to \D$ together with counit/unit natural transformations

$$u \colon FG \to 1_\C, \quad v \colon 1_\D \to GF$$

which satisfy some axioms.

One can think of $F$ and $G$ as being "almost inverses", with the counit/unit pair measuring how far they are from being actual inverses.
Given this setup, the functor $FG$ is an example of a monad, and $GF$ is an example of a comonad.
(Of course a (co)monad is not just a bare functor - one considers the counit and unit to be part of the structure.)

In fact, this is the only source of examples of monads and comonads.
We will provide axiomatic definitions of both terms later on, but it is a theorem that every (co)monad satisfying those axioms is inducd by an adjunction (in fact many adjunctions in general) as described above.

### Example: the product monad

Let us begin by examining the monad and comonad associated to the product / diagonal adjunction constructed in my post on [adjunctions][1].  
This adjunction consisted of the product functor $P \colon \Set^2 \to \Set$ given by $P(X,Y) = X \times Y$ on objects and $P(f,g) = f \times g$ on morphisms together with the diagonal functor $\Delta \colon \Set \colon \Set^2$ given by $\Delta(X) = (X,X)$ on objects and $\Delta(f) = (f,f)$ on morphisms.

The monad associated to this adjunction is the functor

$$P \Delta \colon \Set \colon \Set$$

which sends an object $X$ to $X \times X$ and a morphism $f$ to the morphism $f \times f$.

The comonad associated to this adjunction is the functor

$$\Delta P \colon \Set^2 \to \Set^2$$

which sends an object $(X, Y)$ to $(X \times Y, X \times Y)$ and a morphism $(f, g)$ to the morphism $(f \times g, f \times g)$.

We will discuss the role that the counit and unit natural transformations play in these constructions later on.

### Example: Galois connections

Recall that a Galois connection is an adjunction between two posets (equipped with their natural category structures).
In my [post][2] on the subject, I went through the proof that a Galois connection between $(A, \leq_A)$ and $(B, \leq_B)$ is the same thing as a pair of partial-order-preserving functions $F \colon A \to B$ and $G \colon B \to A$ with the property that

$$
\begin{equation} \label{gal_connection}
   F(a) \leq_B b \iff a \leq_A G(b)
\end{equation}
$$

for every $a \in A$, $b in B$.

What is a monad in this language?
Let $M = FG$; $M$ satisfies three axioms:

1. $M$ is increasing: $M(b_1) \leq_B M(b_2)$ whenever $b_1 \leq_B b_2$.

This follows from the fact that $F$ and $G$ are increasing (which in turn follows from the fact that $F$ and $G$ are functors).

2. $M$ is extensive: $M(b) \leq_B b$ for all $b \in B$.

Indeed, we have $G(b) \leq_A G(b)$ by reflexivity, and thus $FG(b) \leq_B b$ by \eqref{gal_connection}.

3. $M$ is idempotent: $M^2(b) = M(b)$ for all $b \in B$.

To prove this, note that $M^2(b) \leq_B M(b)$ since $M$ is extensive.
Moreover $G(b) \leq_A GFG(b)$ by \eqref{gal_connection} applied to the reflexive inequality $FG(b) \leq_B FG(b)$, and thus $FG(b) \leq_B FGFG(b)$ since $F$ is increasing.
This is equivalent to $M(b) \leq_B M^2(B)$, so we conclude that $M(b) = M^2(B)$ by antisymmetry of $\leq_B$.

A function $M$ which satisfies the three axioms above is traditionally called a **closure operator**, so we have shown that for any Galois connection $(F, G)$ the corresponding monad $M = FG$ is a closure operator.
It will follow from more general considerations involving the relationship between adjunctions and monads that every closure operator comes from a Galois connection as above, so in fact the monads on a poset are precisely the closure operators on that poset.

<div class="exercise">
Show that the comonad $GF$ is a closure operator on the poset obtained by reversing the partial ordering $\leq_A$ on $A$.

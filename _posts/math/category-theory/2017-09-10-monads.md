## Examples of (co)monads

Recall that an adjunction between categories $\C$ and $\D$ consists of a pair of functors $F \colon \D \to \C$ and $G \colon \C \to \D$ together with counit/unit natural transformations

$$u \colon FG \to 1_\C, \quad v \colon 1_\D \to GF$$

which satisfy some axioms.

One can think of $F$ and $G$ as being "almost inverses", with the counit/unit pair measuring how far they are from being actual inverses.
Given this setup, the functor $FG$ is an example of a monad, and $GF$ is an example of a comonad.
(Of course a (co)monad is not just a bare functor - one considers the counit and unit to be part of the structure.)

In fact, this is the only source of examples of monads and comonads.
We will provide axiomatic definitions of both terms later on, but it is a theorem that every (co)monad satisfying those axioms is inducd by an adjunction (in fact many adjunctions in general) as described above.

### Example: the product monad

Let us begin by examining the monad and comonad associated to the product / diagonal adjunction constructed in my post on [adjunctions][1].  
This adjunction consisted of the product functor $P \colon \Set^2 \to \Set$ given by $P(X,Y) = X \times Y$ on objects and $P(f,g) = f \times g$ on morphisms together with the diagonal functor $\Delta \colon \Set \colon \Set^2$ given by $\Delta(X) = (X,X)$ on objects and $\Delta(f) = (f,f)$ on morphisms.

The monad associated to this adjunction is the functor

$$P \Delta \colon \Set \colon \Set$$

which sends an object $X$ to $X \times X$ and a morphism $f$ to the morphism $f \times f$.

The comonad associated to this adjunction is the functor

$$\Delta P \colon \Set^2 \to \Set^2$$

which sends an object $(X, X)$

The main goal of this post is to show how some of the main ingredients of category theory - categories, functors, natural transformations, and so on, can provide a satisfying foundation for the theory of graphs.
My hope is that this post will provide the reader with some intuition and a rich source of examples for more sophisticated category theoretic constructions.

## Categories and Functors

To begin, let us review the definition of a category and of a functor between categories.
This discussion will culminate in an abstract but useful way to think about graphs.

<div class="definition">
A *category* $C$ is a class $\ob(C)$ of objects together with a class $\hom(a,b)$ of *morphisms* between each pair $a, b$ of objects and a composition map $\circ \colon \hom(a,b) \times \hom(b,c) \to \hom(a,c)$ which has the following properties:

- Existence of identies: for each object $a$ there is a morphism $1_a$ in $\hom(a, a)$ which satisfies:

$$1_a \circ f = f, \quad g \circ 1_a = g$$

for every morphism $f \colon x \to a$ and every morphism $g \colon a \to x$.

- Associativity: given morphisms $f \colon a \to b$, $g \colon b \to c$, and $h \colon c \to d$ the triple composition is well-defined independently of parentheses:

$$h \circ (g \circ f) = (h \circ g) \circ f$$

</div>

Note that we do not insist that the objects or morphisms form sets; this is to avoid paradoxes in set theory which arise when one tries to sloppily use set theoretic language to construct very large sets.

<div class="example">
One of the most important examples of a category is the category $\Set$ whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are functions between sets.
For each set $S$ the identity morphism $1_S \colon S \to S$ is the function $1_S(x) = x$, and the composition law for morphisms is just ordinary composition of functions.
</div>

Every category $\mathcal{C}$ has an *opposite*, denoted $\mathcal{C}^{op}$, which is obtained by reversing the morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$.
Thus the objects in $\mathcal{C}^{op}$ are the same, but for every morphism $f \colon a \to b$ in $\mathcal{C}$ there is a morphism $f^{op} \colon b \to a$ in $\mathcal{C}^{op}$.

There is a natural notion of mapping from one category to another, given as follows:

<div class="definition">
Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be categories.
A (covariant) *functor* $F \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ is a mapping which associates to each object $a$ in $\ob(\mathcal{C})$ an object $F(a)$ in $\ob(\mathcal{D})$ and to each morphism $f \colon a \to b$ in $\mathcal{C}$ a morphism $F(f) \colon F(a) \to F(b)$ according to the following properties:

- $F(1\_a) = 1\_{F(a)}$
- $F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f)$

</div>

<div class="example">
Given any category $\mathcal{C}$ the *identity functor* on $\mathcal{C}$ is the functor $\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ which maps each object to itself and each morphism to itself.
</div>

<div class="example">
Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be categories, and fix an object $d$ in $\mathcal{D}$.
The mapping which sends every object in $\mathcal{C}$ to $d$ and every morphism to $1_d$ is a functor $\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$, called a *constant functor*.
</div>

We conclude with an exercise which introduces a category theoretic way to think about graphs.

<div class="exercise">
Let $X$ denote the category with exactly two objects $a$ and $b$ and exactly two distinct morphisms $s, t \colon a \to b$ (together with the identity morphisms $1_a$ and $1_b$).
Show that a graph is the same thing as a functor $X \to \Set$.
<div>
<div class="solution">
Recall that a graph consists of a set $V$ of vertices together with a set $E$ of edges.
Each edge has a source vertex and a target vertex, though in general one allows different edges to have the same source and target; thus part of the structure of the graph is a function $g \colon E \to V \times V$ sending an edge to its source and target vertices. 

Now, let $F \colon X \to \Set$ be a functor.
Since $F$ maps objects to objects we have two sets $F(a)$ and $F(b)$, and since $F$ maps morphisms to morphisms we also have two functions $F(s), F(t) \colon F(a) \to F(b)$.
From these ingredients we aim to manufacture a graph.

The idea is as follows: let $E = F(a)$, $V = F(b)$, and define $g \colon E \to V \times V$ by

$$g(e) = (F(s)(e), F(t)(e))$$

In other words, $F(a)$ is the edge set of the graph, $F(b)$ is the vertex set of the graph, and the maps $F(s)$ and $F(t)$ determine the source and target, respectively, of each edge.

This process is of course reversible: starting with a graph $G = (V, E, g)$ where $g \colon E \to V \times V$ is the source-and-target map, we can construct a functor $F \colon X \to \Set$ as follows.
The values of $F$ on objects is given by $F(a) = E$ and $F(b) = V$.
To define $F$ on morphisms let $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ be the functions $V \times V \to V$ which project onto the first and second factors, respectively, so that $\pi_1(v_1, v_2) = v_1$ and $\pi_2(v_1, v_2) = v_2$.
Finally, define:

$$F(s) = \pi_1 \circ g, \quad F(t) = \pi_2 \circ g$$

Ordinarily we would need to check that $F$ preserves compositions of morphisms, but since there are no nontrivial compositions in $X$ we are done.
</div>

<div class="remark">
Given a category $\mathcal{C}$, a *presheaf* on $\mathcal{C}$ is by definition a functor $F \colon \mathcal{C}^{op} \to \Set$.
So the previous exercise shows that a graph is the same thing as a presheaf on the category $X^{op}$.

A *sheaf* is a presheaf with some additional structure; thanks to the work of Alexander Grothendieck much of modern algebraic geometry (and increasingly the rest of geometry) is organized around the theory of sheaves.
I have also seen sheaves in some computer science papers and so we may need to confront them more seriously later on, but for now we will get by with this parenthetical remark.

## Natural Transformations

In the previous section we precisely defined the notion of a category and of a functor between categories, and we concluded by arguing that a graph can be thought of as a functor $X \to \Set$ where $X$ is a well-chosen category.
In this section we will develop the functorial perspective on graphs further by introducing the concept of a graph homomorphism.

Informally, a graph homomorphism is a mapping from one graph to another which sends vertices to vertices and edges to edges.
To be more precise we will use the definition of a graph introduced in the last section, wherein a graph is a triple $G = (V, E, g)$ consisting of a vertex set, an edge set, and a source-and-target map $g \colon E \to V \times V$. 

<div class="definition">
Let $G_1 = (V_1, E_1, g_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, E_2, g_2)$ be graphs.  A *graph homomorphism* $\phi \colon G_1 \to G_2$ is a pair of functions $\phi_V \colon V_1 \to V_2$ and $\phi_E \colon E_1 \to E_2$ which are compatible with the source-and-target maps in the sense that:

$$g_2 \circ \phi_E = (\phi_V \times \phi_V) \circ g_1$$

</div>

Informally, the compatibility condition is the statement that if we map an edge in $G_1$ to an edge in $G_2$ along $\phi_E$ and then find its source and target vertices, we get the same answer as if we had first found the source and target vertices of the original edge in $G_1$ and then mapped them to $G_2$ along $\phi_V$.
This sort of compatibility condition is quite common in category theory, and they are often expressed using diagrams:

$$
\begin{CD}
E_1 @>{g_1}>> V_1 \times V_1 \\
@VV{\phi_E}V @VV{\phi_V \times \phi_V}V
E_2 @>{g_2}>> V_2 \times V_2 \\
\end{CD}
$$

The compatibility condition is equivalent to the statement that this diagram *commutes*, meaning any chain of morphisms which start and end in the same place will produce the same result.

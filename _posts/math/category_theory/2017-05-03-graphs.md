The main goal of this post is to show how some of the main ingredients of category theory - categories, functors, natural transformations, and so on, can provide a satisfying foundation for the theory of graphs.  My hope is that this post will provide the reader with some intuition and a rich source of examples for more sophisticated category theoretic constructions.

## Categories and Functors

To begin, let us review the definition of a category and of a functor between categories.  This discussion will culminate in an abstract but useful way to think about graphs.

<div class="definition">
A *category* $C$ is a class $\ob(C)$ of objects together with a class $\hom(a,b)$ of *morphisms* between each pair $a, b$ of objects and a composition map $\circ \colon \hom(a,b) \times \hom(b,c) \to \hom(a,c)$ which has the following properties:

- Existence of identies: for each object $a$ there is a morphism $1_a$ in $\hom(a, a)$ which satisfies:

$$1_a \circ f = f, \quad g \circ 1_a = g$$

for every morphism $f \colon x \to a$ and every morphism $g \colon a \to x$.

- Associativity: given morphisms $f \colon a \to b$, $g \colon b \to c$, and $h \colon c \to d$ the triple composition is well-defined independently of parentheses:

$$h \circ (g \circ f) = (h \circ g) \circ f$$
</div>

Note that we do not insist that the objects or morphisms form sets; this is to avoid paradoxes in set theory which arise when one tries to sloppily use set theoretic language to construct very large sets.

<div class="example">
One of the most important examples of a category is the category $\Set$ whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are functions between sets.  For each set $S$ the identity morphism $1_S \colon S \to S$ is the function $1_S(x) = x$, and the composition law for morphisms is just ordinary composition of functions.
</div>

Every category $\mathcal{C}$ has an *opposite*, denoted $\mathcal{C}^{op}$, which is obtained by reversing the morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$.  Thus the objects in $\mathcal{C}^{op}$ are the same, but for every morphism $f \colon a \to b$ in $\mathcal{C}$ there is a morphism $f^{op} \colon b \to a$ in $\mathcal{C}^\op$.

There is a natural notion of mapping from one category to another, given as follows:

<div class="definition">
Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be categories.  A (covariant) *functor* $F \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ is a mapping which associates to each object $a$ in $\ob(\mathcal{C})$ an object $F(a)$ in $\ob(\mathcal{D}$ and to each morphism $f \colon a \to b$ in $\mathcal{C}$ a morphism $F(f) \colon F(a) \to F(b)$ according to the following properties:

- $F(1_a) = 1_{F(a)}$
- $F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f)$
</div>

<div class="example">
Given any category $\mathcal{C}$ the *identity functor* on $\mathcal{C}$ is the functor $1_\mathcal{C} \to 1_\mathcal{C}$ which maps each object to itself and each morphism to itself.
</div>

<div class="example">
Let $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ be categories, and fix an object $d$ in $\mathcal{D}$.  The mapping which sends every object in $\mathcal{C}$ to $d$ and every morphism to $1_d$ is a functor $\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$, called a *constant functor*.
</div>

We conclude with an exercise which introduces a category theoretic way to think about graphs.

<div class="exercise">
Let $X$ denote the category with exactly two objects $a$ and $b$ and exactly two distinct morphisms $s, t \colon a \to b$ (together with the identity morphisms $1_a$ and $1_b$).  Show that a graph is the same thing as a functor $X \to \Set$.
<div>
<div class="solution">
Recall that a graph consists of a set $V$ of vertices together with a set $E$ of edges.  Each edge has a source vertex and a target vertex, though in general one allows different edges to have the same source and target; thus part of the structure of the graph is a function $g \colon E \to V \times V$ sending an edge to its source and target vertices. 

Now, let $F \colon X \to \Set$ be a functor.
Since $F$ maps objects to objects we have two sets $F(a)$ and $F(b)$, and since $F$ maps morphisms to morphisms we also have two functions $F(s), F(t) \colon F(a) \to F(b)$.
From these ingredients we aim to manufacture a graph.

The idea is as follows: let $E = F(a)$, $V = F(b)$, and define $g \colon E \to V \times V$ by

$$g(e) = (F(s)(e), F(t)(e))$$

In other words, $F(a)$ is the edge set of the graph, $F(b)$ is the vertex set of the graph, and the maps $F(s)$ and $F(t)$ determine the source and target, respectively, of each edge.

This process is of course reversible: starting with a graph $G = (V, E, g)$ where $g \colon E \to V \times V$ is the source-and-target map, we can construct a functor $F \colon X \to \Set$ as follows.
The values of $F$ on objects is given by $F(a) = E$ and $F(b) = V$.
To define $F$ on morphisms let $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ be the functions $V \times V \to V$ which project onto the first and second factors, respectively, so that $\pi_1(v_1, v_2) = v_1$ and $\pi_2(v_1, v_2) = v_2$.
Finally, define:

$$F(s) = \pi_1 \circ g, \quad F(t) = \pi_2 \circ g$$

Ordinarily we would need to check that $F$ preserves compositions of morphisms, but since there are no nontrivial compositions in $X$ we are done.

Consider the set $\Z$ of all integers and the set $\Q$ of all rational numbers (i.e. ratios of integers).
These sets each come equipped with a relation $\leq$, where in both sets $a_1 \leq a_2$ simply means that $a_1$ is less than or equal to $a_2$.
This relation is characterized by a few simple properties:

1. Reflexivity: $a_1 \leq a_1$ for all $a_1$
2. Antisymmetry: if $a_1 \leq a_2$ and $a_2 \leq a_1$ then $a_1 = a_2$
3. Transitivity: if $a_1 \leq a_2$ and $a_2 \leq a_3$ then $a_1 \leq a_3$

A relation $\leq$ on a set $S$ which satisfies these three properties is called a *partial ordering* on $S$, and $S$ equipped with $\leq$ is called a *poset* (short for "partially ordered set").

<div class="exercise">
Let $(A, \leq_A)$ and $(B, \leq_B)$ be posets.
Define a relation $\leq$ on $A \times B$ by declaring that $(a_1, b_1) \leq (a_2, b_2)$ if either $a_1 \neq a_2$ and $a_1 \leq a_2$ or $a_1 = a_2$ and $b_1 \leq b_2$.
Show that this is a partial ordering on $A \times B$, called the *lexigraphical* partial ordering.

## Posets as categories

The main point of this post is that any poset has the structure of a category, and that it can be useful and interesting to view it as such.

So let $(S, \leq)$ be a poset.
Consider the category (which, abusing notation, we will also refer to as $S$) whose objects are the elements of $S$ and which has exactly one morphism from $a_1$ to $a_2$ whenever $a_1 \leq a_2$.
We define composition as follows: if $f \colon a_1 \to a_2$ and $g \colon a_2 \to a_3$ are morphisms then by definition $a_1 \leq a_2$ and $a_2 \leq a_3$, so by transitivity $a_1 \leq a_3$ and thus we can define the composition $g \circ f$ to be the unique morphism from $a_1$ to $a_3$.

Let us check that these objects and morphisms really do determine a category; in other words, we must show that composition is associative and that each object has an identity morphism.

Associativity is straightforward since each pair of objects has at most one morphism: given $f \colon a_1 \to a_2$, $g \colon a_2 \to a_3$, and $h \colon a_3 \to a_4$, we have that $h \circ (g \circ f)$ and $(h \circ g) \circ f$ each correspond to the unique morphism from $a_1$ to $a_4$.

Given an object $a$, note that $a \leq a$ by reflexivity of $\leq$, so define $1_a \colon a \to a$ to be the unique morphism from $a$ to itself.
Let us check that $1_a$ is an identity morphism.
Given a morphism $f \colon a \to a_0$, $f \circ 1_a$ is by definition of composition the unique morphism from $a$ to $a_0$.
But $f$ is a morphism from $a$ to $a_0$, so by uniqueness $f = f \circ 1_a$.
A similar argument shows that $g = 1_a \circ g$ for any morphism $g \colon a_1 \to a$.

## Functors between posets

Let $(A, \leq_A$ and $(B, \leq_B)$ be two posets, viewed as categories according to the previous section.
Viewing these posets as categories, let us unravel the meaning of a functor $F \colon (A, \leq_A) \to (B, \leq_B)$.

A functor must map objects in $A$ to objects in $B$; since the objects in $A$ and $B$ correspond to elements of the underlying sets, this means that $F$ is a function from the set $A$ to the set $B$.
But $F$ also maps each morphism $f \colon a_1 \to a_2$ to a morphism $F(f) \colon F(a_1) \to F(a_2)$.
The condition that there is a morphism $a_1 \to a_2$ means $a_1 \leq_A a_2$, and the condition that there is a morphism $F(a_1) \to F(a_2)$ means $F(a_1) \leq_B F(a_2)$.

So a $F$ determines a function $A \to B$ which preserves the partial ordering, in the sense that $F(a_1) \leq_B F(a_2)$ whenever $a_1 \leq_A a_2$.
The reader is invited to check that any such function determines a functor $(A, \leq_A) \to (B, \leq_B)$, so a functor between posets is the same thing as a function between the underlying sets which preserves the partial ordering.

<div class="example">
Consider the integers $\Z$ and the rational numbers $\Q$ equipped with the standard partial ordering $\leq$.
The inclusion $\Z \to \Q$ which sends an integer $n$ to itself (viewed as the fraction $\frac{n}{1}$) preserves $\leq$ and hence defines a functor from the poset $\Z$ to the poset $\Q$.

Moreover the function $\Q \to \Z$ which rounds down each rational number also preserves $\leq$ and hence defines a functor from $\Q$ to $\Z$.

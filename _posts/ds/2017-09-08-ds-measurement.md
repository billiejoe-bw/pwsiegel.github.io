One of the hardest - and most important - parts of doing data science in industry is measurement.
The allure of sophisticated machine learning models and adaptive artificially intelligent systems can be irresistable, but it must be tempered by a commitment to answering a few simple questions:

- Does the system actually work?
- Is it fit for purpose?
- Will it accomplish the business objectives that motivated its development?

Undoubtedly it is important to ask such questions about any commercial product, but I think there are some unique challenges involved in answering them with respect to data science products.
Part of the problem is that data science is a relatively young field, and there isn't always reliable academic literature or publicly available industry benchmarks for the more ambitious data science projects.
Additionally, standard measurement frameworks aren't always useful for answering the third question - some businesses and some customers have more stringent requirements than others.

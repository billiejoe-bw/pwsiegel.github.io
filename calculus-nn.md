# From Calculus to Machine Learning

This is the home page for a sort of seminar that I am helping to organize at Brandwatch on the mathematical foundations of machine learning.
The target audience for this seminar consists of either data analysts or engineers who are interested in machine learning and would like to get more comfortable with the theory.
The prerequisites aren't too severe - just finite dimensional optimization and some basic probability / statistics - but it can be tough to learn them outside of a classroom setting.

## Part I: Optimization

1. One variable optimization
   * Optimizing quadratic functions (slides, problems)
